E-Commerce Back End
The E-Commerce Back End is a Node.js application that provides the back-end functionality for an internet retail (e-commerce) website. It utilizes the Express.js framework for building APIs and Sequelize as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to interact with a MySQL database. The application allows managers at an internet retail company to manage categories, products, and tags.

Usage
To run the E-Commerce Back End application, you'll need to follow these steps:

Ensure that you have a MySQL server installed and running on your machine.

Create a new .env file in the root directory of the project and add your database credentials:

makefile
Copy code
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=your_host
Replace your_database_name, your_username, your_password, and your_host with your actual database credentials and connection settings.

Create the database schema by running the following command in your terminal:

arduino
Copy code
npm run create-db
This will execute the SQL commands from db/schema.sql and create the necessary tables.

Seed the database with test data by running the following command:

arduino
Copy code
npm run seed
This will populate the database with sample data for categories, products, and tags.

Start the application by running:

sql
Copy code
npm start
The server will start, and you should see a message indicating that the app is listening on a specific port.

Database Configuration
The E-Commerce Back End uses Sequelize as the ORM to interact with a MySQL database. The database configuration can be found in the config/connection.js file. Ensure that you have provided the correct database credentials in this file, as shown below:

javascript
Copy code
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');

const sequelize = new Sequelize('your_database_name', 'your_username', 'your_password', {
  host: 'your_host', // e.g., 'localhost' if the MySQL server is running on the same machine
  dialect: 'mysql',
});

module.exports = sequelize;
Replace 'your_database_name', 'your_username', 'your_password', and 'your_host' with your actual database credentials and connection settings.

Walkthrough Video
Provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the application, including the routes and interactions with the database.
